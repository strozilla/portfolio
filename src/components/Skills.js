						<h3>Self Development</h3>
						<p>
							I use a multitude of resources to continue to develop and hone my
							skills. As someone who is truly passionate about coding and the
							tech industry, I am always reading articles, blogs, or watching
							videos on new or different ways to code. Whether for my career
							path or life path, I strive to keep learning and progressing.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li className="icon solid fa-code">
						<h3>Coding</h3>
						<p>
							Working mainly with Front-End: HTML | CSS | JS | REACT | jQuery
							<br />
							Currently Learning Back-End: Django | Ruby on Rails | Java |
						</p>
					</li>
					<li className="icon solid fa-box">
						<h3>Organization</h3>
						<p>
							I try to keep my environment, thoughts and tasks organized. I use
							a planner for day to day tasks as well as a notebook for more
							in-depth notes. As a Handyman, I had to orchestrate several
							different moving parts, in order to get projects done. I had to
							stay very organized to keep myself, as well as those I
							subcontracted, on schedule.
							<br />
							These skills translate well into the web develpment environment.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li className="icon fa-heart">
						<h3>Teamwork</h3>
						<p>
							I am very much so a team player, although, I tend to land/enjoy
							leadership roles. I believe effective and continued communication
							plays a huge role in teamwork.
